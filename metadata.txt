description=This plugin simplifies a rcl map to segment map in preparation for angular segment analysis using Depthmap.

about=This is a plugin to simplify a road centre line map to a segment map in preparation for angular segment analysis using Depthmap or the Space Syntax Toolkit plugin in QGIS.
      This plugin was developed by Space Syntax Open Digital Works (C) 2016 Space Syntax Ltd.
      The input is a road centre line map (works with OSM and OS maps) and the output is a segment map optimised in terms of angular change and number of nodes in its dual graph representation.
      The simplification process consists of two sequential steps according to the two tabs of the plugin:
       1. Simplification of angle
       2. Simplification of intersections
